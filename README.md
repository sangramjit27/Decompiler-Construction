# Academic Decompiler System

## Overview
This project is an academic decompiler system developed to demonstrate how
compiler construction concepts can be applied in reverse to analyze low-level
program representations and reconstruct higher-level logic.

The goal of this project is not to perfectly regenerate original source code,
but to explore the challenges, limitations, and techniques involved in
reverse translation, program analysis, and abstraction recovery.

This project was developed strictly for educational and research purposes.

## Problem Statement
While compilers translate high-level source code into low-level representations,
understanding how much semantic information can be recovered from compiled code
remains a complex problem. This project explores:

- How program structure degrades during compilation
- What semantic patterns can still be inferred
- How compiler phases can be conceptually reversed

---

## Core Concepts Used
- Lexical and syntactic analysis (reverse mapping)
- Intermediate Representation (IR) reconstruction
- Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis
- Instruction pattern recognition
- Static program analysis techniques

---

## System Workflow
1. Input: Low-level or intermediate code representation
2. Instruction parsing and normalization
3. Control flow reconstruction
4. Pattern-based abstraction
5. Generation of high-level pseudo-code or structured output

---

## Key Features
- Demonstrates reverse application of compiler phases
- Highlights information loss during compilation
- Produces readable high-level representations (not exact source code)
- Modular architecture for analysis stages

---

## Scope & Limitations
- This is **not** a commercial decompiler
- Does not aim to reproduce original variable names or comments
- Focuses on conceptual correctness over completeness
- Intended for learning and research, not software reverse engineering

---

## Technologies Used
- Python / C (depending on your implementation)
- Compiler design principles
- Static analysis techniques
- Data structures for program representation

---

## Ethical & Legal Notice
This project is developed strictly for academic learning.
No proprietary binaries, copyrighted software, or confidential code
are analyzed or included.
